# Flexible Tactile Sensing Module with Dual Sensors

## Description

This project features a **flexible tactile sensing module** equipped with **dual pressure sensors** designed to measure **tactile interaction**, specifically the pressure exerted by external forces. At the core of the module are two **BMP384 barometric pressure sensors** â€” MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) sensors capable of measuring both **barometric pressure** and **temperature** with low power consumption. Their sensitivity makes them well-suited for tactile feedback and subtle pressure variation detection.

The **spacing between the two BMP384 sensors** is **3 millimeters**, allowing for localized differential pressure sensing. Both sensors communicate via the **I2C protocol**, ensuring straightforward integration with microcontroller boards such as the **Arduino Due**. The module operates at **3.3V**, and each sensor is assigned a unique I2C address to enable communication on the same bus:

- **Top Sensor**: `0x77`  
- **Bottom Sensor**: `0x76`

This tactile sensing module can be used in robotics, prosthetics, and human-machine interaction applications.

The **sensor module** is designed on a **flexible PCB**, making it adaptable to a wide range of environments where flexibility is essential. The design is created using **Eagle 7.7**, and the board is populated using **surface-mount technology (SMT)**. After population, the board has been tested with an **Arduino Due** to verify its sensor performance and sampling rate for tactile sensing applications.
